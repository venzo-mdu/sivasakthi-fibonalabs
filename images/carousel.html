        <div class="formclient-details">
          We needed professionalism, experience, and someone that could consolidate our ideas into a design within
          timelines. We needed a partner that would efficiently guide us through the process without wasting our time. I
          was looking for someone that was able to attain global standards on design, and a place where I did not have
          to compromise on quality. I found this in Fibonalabs.

        We, the Fintso founding team, did this three day design thinking workshop with Fibonalabs team right at the
        beginning of our journey, and at the end of those three days, we had a much better understanding of what we were
        trying to build and what our customers really wanted us to build. The workshop was a great collaborative
        thinking experience that set the path for the first six months of our brand and business journey.

      <div class="formclient2-details">We at Smile Genius were looking for a professional and reliable company to work
        with on our idea. We had meetings with quite a few companies in Ireland, UK, Poland, and India. The companies/
        individuals were either pure developers with no design experience or only had design experience. We were looking
        for not a supplier but a partner. I spoke to the Fibonalabs team and was impressed after the first meeting. Our
        belief in the company strengthened day by day, starting with the in-depth marathon workshops on design.
        Fibonalabs
        team is very professional and very strong. We look forward to working with them for our future phases as well.
